test2.html is the main html file
test2.css and benchmark_...css are css files
test2.js is JS file
index.html is same as test2.html, it is used for deploying code, you can ignore it right now.
A lof of files are just images, which shall be stored better into a folder.

Sorry for such a messy file structure, it will be corrected someday :)
